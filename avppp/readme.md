Welcome to <span style="font-weight: bold">A VERY PARTICULAR PARTICLE PLAYGROUND</span>, a passion project because I'm obsessed with math. It uses computations <span style="font-style: italic">loosely based</span> on real life equations, with adjustments to fit the project and make it look cool. A neat library this experience utilizes is <a href="https://github.com/Debroskii/panel5">PANEL5</a>, a library I created in parallel to this project to just have fun and make future <a href="https://p5js.org/">p5.js</a> projects easier. You have two objects you'll often interact with, <span style="font-weight: bold">Emitters</span>, and <span style="font-weight: bold">Attractors</span>, which create and/or manipulate particles. Theres a lot of customization oppurtunities, so every scene you make will probably be different.
